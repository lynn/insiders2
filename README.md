# insiders2

Tools for translating "[Insiders: Network no Bouken: Eve ga Inai](https://refuge.tokyo/pc9801/pc98/01935.html)" (PC-98).

`python main.py` reads `"Insiders - Network no Bouken - Eve ga Inai.nfd"` and writes `patched.nfd`.

I borrowed the code in codec.py from [hollowaytape](https://github.com/46OkuMen/insiders): both Insiders games are encrypted the same way. Thanks!
